This project is part of a Final Project for Mobile Application Programming (PPB).

Note: This application is designed for road maintenance professionals and authorities to efficiently identify and document road damage for maintenance planning.

Notes
The app name "Roady" is defined in the string resources strings.xml:3 , and the application uses Indonesian language for user interface elements and AI responses. The codebase shows a well-structured Android application with proper separation of concerns between UI components, business logic, and external service integrations.
